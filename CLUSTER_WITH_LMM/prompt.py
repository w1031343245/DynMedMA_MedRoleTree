   Instruction:
   You are an expert tasked with merging two given labels into a single, higher-level label that accurately represents their common theme.

   Requirements:
   1. Read the following labels carefully:
      - Label 1: '''{label1}'''
      - Label 2: '''{label2}'''

   2. Identify a single, higher-level label that captures the common theme between the two labels. This new label must adhere to the following rules:
      - The label should be 'concise', 'highly relevant', and 'widely accepted' in its domain.
      - If the labels seem too specific or niche, increase the abstraction level to a broader concept. For example, if the labels are very detailed, consider using a more general term that encompasses both. Aim to avoid overly specific labels unless absolutely necessary.
      
   3. When considering abstraction, remember:
      - The new label should be a 'single term' that groups both labels under a common umbrella. 
      - 'Avoid using overly niche terms'. For instance, if combining "Diabetes" and "Hypertension", donâ€™t use terms like "Chronic Kidney Disease". Instead, aim for a broader concept like "Cardiometabolic Diseases."

   4. The cluster label must not exceed 30 characters in length.

   5. Output the final label only. Do 'not' provide any additional explanations or rationale.

   6. Output format:
       ```
       Label: label1, label2
       Cluster label: new_label
       ```

    Example:
    Input:
    ```
    Label 1: Hypertension
    Label 2: Heart Disease
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    Label: Hypertension, Heart Disease
    Cluster label: Cardiovascular Disease
    ```

   Instruction:
You are tasked with merging two given labels into a single, higher-level concept that reflects their common theme.

Steps:
1. Review the following labels:
   Label 1: '''{label1}'''
   Label 2: '''{label2}'''

2. Create a higher-level label that captures the shared theme of the two labels. The new label must:
   Exclude the following labels: '''{fail_label_str}'''. These labels should not be considered, even if they seem related.

3. Guidelines for abstraction:
   Choose a 'general concept' that groups both labels under a broader umbrella. For instance, "Musculoskeletal Disorders" is a better fit for "Arthritis" and "Osteoporosis" than something overly specific like "Bone Degeneration".

4. The final label must be concise, with no more than 30 characters.

5. Only output the final label. Do not provide additional explanations or reasoning.

6. Important: Avoid using the labels provided '''{fail_label}''' above as part of the new, higher-level label.
